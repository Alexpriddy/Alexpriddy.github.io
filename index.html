				<p>On my website I want it to be very advanced. I like the challenge and want to get really good at coding. On my website for colors mostly they will be shades of light blue. And for fonts i don't like the flashy or fancy fonts so i went with some basic fonts. I don't play any sports at the moment, or clubs of any sort. My hobbies include Photoshop, Video games, And watching shows. I want to get a job that includes coding and maybe design. I'm not sure where I want to go to college but mostly just a community college. I want to be a advanced coder for my career</p>
